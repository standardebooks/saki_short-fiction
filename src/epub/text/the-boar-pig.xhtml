			<h2>The Boar-Pig</h2>
<p>The hunting season had come to an end, and the Mullets had not
succeeded in selling the Brogue. There had been a kind of
tradition in the family for the past three or four years, a sort
of fatalistic hope, that the Brogue would find a purchaser before
the hunting was over; but seasons came and went without anything
happening to justify such ill-founded optimism. The animal
had been named Berserker in the earlier stages of its career; it
had been rechristened the Brogue later on, in recognition of the
fact that, once acquired, it was extremely difficult to get rid
of. The unkinder wits of the neighbourhood had been known
to suggest that the first letter of its name was
superfluous. The Brogue had been variously described in
sale catalogues as a light-weight hunter, a lady’s hack,
and, more simply, but still with a touch of imagination, as a
useful brown gelding, standing 15.1. Toby Mullet had ridden
him for four seasons with the West Wessex; you can ride almost
any sort of horse with the West Wessex as long as it is an animal
that knows the country. The Brogue knew the country
intimately, having personally created most of the gaps that were
to be met with in banks and hedges for many miles round.
His manners and characteristics were not ideal in the hunting
field, but he was probably rather safer to ride to hounds than he
was as a hack on country roads. According to the Mullet
family, he was not really road-shy, but there were one or two
objects of dislike that brought on sudden attacks of what Toby
called the swerving sickness. Motors and cycles he treated
with tolerant disregard, but pigs, wheelbarrows, piles of stones
by the roadside, perambulators in a village street, gates painted
too aggressively white, and sometimes, but not always, the newer
kind of beehives, turned him aside from his tracks in vivid
imitation of the zigzag course of forked lightning. If a
pheasant rose noisily from the other side of a hedgerow the
Brogue would spring into the air at the same moment, but this may
have been due to a desire to be companionable. The Mullet
family contradicted the widely prevalent report that the horse
was a confirmed crib-biter.</p>
<p>It was about the third week in May that Mrs. Mullet, relict of
the late Sylvester Mullet, and mother of Toby and a bunch of
daughters, assailed Clovis Sangrail on the outskirts of the
village with a breathless catalogue of local happenings.</p>
<p>“You know our new neighbour, Mr. Penricarde?” she
vociferated; “awfully rich, owns tin mines in Cornwall,
middle-aged and rather quiet. He’s taken the Red
House on a long lease and spent a lot of money on alterations and
improvements. Well, Toby’s sold him the
Brogue!”</p>
<p>Clovis spent a moment or two in assimilating the astonishing
news; then he broke out into unstinted congratulation. If
he had belonged to a more emotional race he would probably have
kissed Mrs. Mullet.</p>
<p>“How wonderfully lucky to have pulled it off at
last! Now you can buy a decent animal. I’ve
always said that Toby was clever. Ever so many
congratulations.”</p>
<p>“Don’t congratulate me. It’s the most
unfortunate thing that could have happened!” said Mrs.
Mullet dramatically.</p>
<p>Clovis stared at her in amazement.</p>
<p>“Mr. Penricarde,” said Mrs. Mullet, sinking her
voice to what she imagined to be an impressive whisper, though it
rather resembled a hoarse, excited squeak, “Mr. Penricarde
has just begun to pay attentions to Jessie. Slight at
first, but now unmistakable. I was a fool not to have seen
it sooner. Yesterday, at the Rectory garden party, he asked
her what her favourite flowers were, and she told him carnations,
and to-day a whole stack of carnations has arrived, clove and
malmaison and lovely dark red ones, regular exhibition blooms,
and a box of chocolates that he must have got on purpose from
London. And he’s asked her to go round the links with
him to-morrow. And now, just at this critical moment, Toby
has sold him that animal. It’s a calamity!”</p>
<p>“But you’ve been trying to get the horse off your
hands for years,” said Clovis.</p>
<p>“I’ve got a houseful of daughters,” said
Mrs. Mullet, “and I’ve been trying—well, not to
get them off my hands, of course, but a husband or two
wouldn’t be amiss among the lot of them; there are six of
them, you know.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” said Clovis,
“I’ve never counted, but I expect you’re right
as to the number; mothers generally know these things.”</p>
<p>“And now,” continued Mrs. Mullet, in her tragic
whisper, “when there’s a rich husband-in-prospect
imminent on the horizon Toby goes and sells him that miserable
animal. It will probably kill him if he tries to ride it;
anyway it will kill any affection he might have felt towards any
member of our family. What is to be done? We
can’t very well ask to have the horse back; you see, we
praised it up like anything when we thought there was a chance of
his buying it, and said it was just the animal to suit
him.”</p>
<p>“Couldn’t you steal it out of his stable and send
it to grass at some farm miles away?” suggested Clovis;
“write ‘Votes for Women’ on the stable door,
and the thing would pass for a Suffragette outrage. No one
who knew the horse could possibly suspect you of wanting to get
it back again.”</p>
<p>“Every newspaper in the country would ring with the
affair,” said Mrs. Mullet; “can’t you imagine
the headline, ‘Valuable Hunter Stolen by
Suffragettes’? The police would scour the countryside
till they found the animal.”</p>
<p>“Well, Jessie must try and get it back from Penricarde
on the plea that it’s an old favourite. She can say
it was only sold because the stable had to be pulled down under
the terms of an old repairing lease, and that now it has been
arranged that the stable is to stand for a couple of years
longer.”</p>
<p>“It sounds a queer proceeding to ask for a horse back
when you’ve just sold him,” said Mrs. Mullet,
“but something must be done, and done at once. The
man is not used to horses, and I believe I told him it was as
quiet as a lamb. After all, lambs go kicking and twisting
about as if they were demented, don’t they?”</p>
<p>“The lamb has an entirely unmerited character for
sedateness,” agreed Clovis.</p>
<p>Jessie came back from the golf links next day in a state of
mingled elation and concern.</p>
<p>“It’s all right about the proposal,” she
announced; “he came out with it at the sixth hole. I
said I must have time to think it over. I accepted him at
the seventh.”</p>
<p>“My dear,” said her mother, “I think a
little more maidenly reserve and hesitation would have been
advisable, as you’ve known him so short a time. You
might have waited till the ninth hole.”</p>
<p>“The seventh is a very long hole,” said Jessie;
“besides, the tension was putting us both off our
game. By the time we’d got to the ninth hole
we’d settled lots of things. The honeymoon is to be
spent in Corsica, with perhaps a flying visit to Naples if we
feel like it, and a week in London to wind up with. Two of
his nieces are to be asked to be bridesmaids, so with our lot
there will be seven, which is rather a lucky number. You
are to wear your pearl grey, with any amount of Honiton lace
jabbed into it. By the way, he’s coming over this
evening to ask your consent to the whole affair. So far
all’s well, but about the Brogue it’s a different
matter. I told him the legend about the stable, and how
keen we were about buying the horse back, but he seems equally
keen on keeping it. He said he must have horse exercise now
that he’s living in the country, and he’s going to
start riding to-morrow. He’s ridden a few times in
the Row, on an animal that was accustomed to carry octogenarians
and people undergoing rest cures, and that’s about all his
experience in the saddle—oh, and he rode a pony once in
Norfolk, when he was fifteen and the pony twenty-four; and
to-morrow he’s going to ride the Brogue! I shall be a
widow before I’m married, and I do so want to see what
Corsica’s like; it looks so silly on the map.”</p>
<p>Clovis was sent for in haste, and the developments of the
situation put before him.</p>
<p>“Nobody can ride that animal with any safety,”
said Mrs. Mullet, “except Toby, and he knows by long
experience what it is going to shy at, and manages to swerve at
the same time.”</p>
<p>“I did hint to Mr. Penricarde—to Vincent, I should
say—that the Brogue didn’t like white gates,”
said Jessie.</p>
<p>“White gates!” exclaimed Mrs. Mullet; “did
you mention what effect a pig has on him? He’ll have
to go past Lockyer’s farm to get to the high road, and
there’s sure to be a pig or two grunting about in the
lane.”</p>
<p>“He’s taken rather a dislike to turkeys
lately,” said Toby.</p>
<p>“It’s obvious that Penricarde mustn’t be
allowed to go out on that animal,” said Clovis, “at
least not till Jessie has married him, and tired of him. I
tell you what: ask him to a picnic to-morrow, starting at an
early hour; he’s not the sort to go out for a ride before
breakfast. The day after I’ll get the rector to drive
him over to Crowleigh before lunch, to see the new cottage
hospital they’re building there. The Brogue will be
standing idle in the stable and Toby can offer to exercise it;
then it can pick up a stone or something of the sort and go
conveniently lame. If you hurry on the wedding a bit the
lameness fiction can be kept up till the ceremony is safely
over.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Mullet belonged to an emotional race, and she kissed
Clovis.</p>
<p>It was nobody’s fault that the rain came down in
torrents the next morning, making a picnic a fantastic
impossibility. It was also nobody’s fault, but sheer
ill-luck, that the weather cleared up sufficiently in the
afternoon to tempt Mr. Penricarde to make his first essay with
the Brogue. They did not get as far as the pigs at
Lockyer’s farm; the rectory gate was painted a dull
unobtrusive green, but it had been white a year or two ago, and
the Brogue never forgot that he had been in the habit of making a
violent curtsey, a back-pedal and a swerve at this particular
point of the road. Subsequently, there being apparently no
further call on his services, he broke his way into the rectory
orchard, where he found a hen turkey in a coop; later visitors to
the orchard found the coop almost intact, but very little left of
the turkey.</p>
<p>Mr. Penricarde, a little stunned and shaken, and suffering
from a bruised knee and some minor damages, good-naturedly
ascribed the accident to his own inexperience with horses and
country roads, and allowed Jessie to nurse him back into complete
recovery and golf-fitness within something less than a week.</p>
<p>In the list of wedding presents which the local newspaper
published a fortnight or so later appeared the following
item:</p>
<p>“Brown saddle-horse, ‘The Brogue,’
bridegroom’s gift to bride.”</p>
<p>“Which shows,” said Toby Mullet, “that he
knew nothing.”</p>
<p>“Or else,” said Clovis, “that he has a very
pleasing wit.”</p>
