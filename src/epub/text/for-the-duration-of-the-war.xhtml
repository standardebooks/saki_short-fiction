			<h2>For the Duration of the War</h2>
<p>The Rev. Wilfrid Gaspilton, in one of those clerical
migrations inconsequent-seeming to the lay mind, had removed from
the moderately fashionable parish of St. Luke’s,
Kensingate, to the immoderately rural parish of St. Chuddocks,
somewhere in Yondershire. There were doubtless substantial
advantages connected with the move, but there were certainly some
very obvious drawbacks. Neither the migratory clergyman nor
his wife were able to adapt themselves naturally and comfortably
to the conditions of country life. Beryl, Mrs. Gaspilton,
had always looked indulgently on the country as a place where
people of irreproachable income and hospitable instincts
cultivated tennis-lawns and rose-gardens and Jacobean
pleasaunces, wherein selected gatherings of interested week-end
guests might disport themselves. Mrs. Gaspilton considered
herself as distinctly an interesting personality, and from a
limited standpoint she was doubtless right. She had
indolent dark eyes and a comfortable chin, which belied the
slightly plaintive inflection which she threw into her voice at
suitable intervals. She was tolerably well satisfied with
the smaller advantages of life, but she regretted that Fate had
not seen its way to reserve for her some of the ampler successes
for which she felt herself well qualified. She would have
liked to be the centre of a literary, slightly political salon,
where discerning satellites might have recognised the breadth of
her outlook on human affairs and the undoubted smallness of her
feet. As it was, Destiny had chosen for her that she should
be the wife of a rector, and had now further decreed that a
country rectory should be the background to her existence.
She rapidly made up her mind that her surroundings did not call
for exploration; Noah had predicted the Flood, but no one
expected him to swim about in it. Digging in a wet garden
or trudging through muddy lanes were exertions which she did not
propose to undertake. As long as the garden produced
asparagus and carnations at pleasingly frequent intervals Mrs.
Gaspilton was content to approve of its expense and otherwise
ignore its existence. She would fold herself up, so to
speak, in an elegant, indolent little world of her own, enjoying
the minor recreations of being gently rude to the doctor’s
wife and continuing the leisurely production of her one literary
effort, <i>The Forbidden Horsepond</i>, a translation of Baptiste
Leopoy’s <i>L’Abreuvoir interdit</i>. It was a
labour which had already been so long drawn-out that it seemed
probable that Baptiste Lepoy would drop out of vogue before her
translation of his temporarily famous novel was finished.
However, the languid prosecution of the work had invested Mrs.
Gaspilton with a certain literary dignity, even in Kensingate
circles, and would place her on a pinnacle in St. Chuddocks,
where hardly any one read French, and assuredly no one had heard
of <i>L’Abreuvoir interdit</i>.</p>
<p>The Rector’s wife might be content to turn her back
complacently on the country; it was the Rector’s tragedy
that the country turned its back on him. With the best
intention in the world and the immortal example of Gilbert White
before him, the Rev. Wilfrid found himself as bored and ill at
ease in his new surroundings as Charles II would have been at a
modern Wesleyan Conference. The birds that hopped across
his lawn hopped across it as though it were their lawn, and not
his, and gave him plainly to understand that in their eyes he was
infinitely less interesting than a garden worm or the rectory
cat. The hedgeside and meadow flowers were equally
uninspiring; the lesser celandine seemed particularly unworthy of
the attention that English poets had bestowed on it, and the
Rector knew that he would be utterly miserable if left alone for
a quarter of an hour in its company. With the human
inhabitants of his parish he was no better off; to know them was
merely to know their ailments, and the ailments were almost
invariably rheumatism. Some, of course, had other bodily
infirmities, but they always had rheumatism as well. The
Rector had not yet grasped the fact that in rural cottage life
not to have rheumatism is as glaring an omission as not to have
been presented at Court would be in more ambitious circles.
And with all this death of local interest there was Beryl
shutting herself off with her ridiculous labours on <i>The
Forbidden Horsepond</i>.</p>
<p>“I don’t see why you should suppose that any one
wants to read Baptiste Lepoy in English,” the Reverend
Wilfrid remarked to his wife one morning, finding her surrounded
with her usual elegant litter of dictionaries, fountain pens, and
scribbling paper; “hardly any one bothers to read him now
in France.”</p>
<p>“My dear,” said Beryl, with an intonation of
gentle weariness, “haven’t two or three leading
London publishers told me they wondered no one had ever
translated <i>L’Abreuvoir interdit</i>, and begged
me—”</p>
<p>“Publishers always clamour for the books that no one has
ever written, and turn a cold shoulder on them as soon as
they’re written. If St. Paul were living now they
would pester him to write an Epistle to the Esquimaux, but no
London publisher would dream of reading his Epistle to the
Ephesians.”</p>
<p>“Is there any asparagus in the garden?” asked
Beryl; “because I’ve told cook—”</p>
<p>“Not anywhere in the garden,” snapped the Rector,
“but there’s no doubt plenty in the asparagus-bed,
which is the usual place for it.”</p>
<p>And he walked away into the region of fruit trees and
vegetable beds to exchange irritation for boredom. It was
there, among the gooseberry bushes and beneath the medlar trees,
that the temptation to the perpetration of a great literary fraud
came to him.</p>
<p>Some weeks later the <i>Bi-Monthly Review</i> gave to the
world, under the guarantee of the Rev. Wilfrid Gaspilton, some
fragments of Persian verse, alleged to have been unearthed and
translated by a nephew who was at present campaigning somewhere
in the Tigris valley. The Rev. Wilfrid possessed a host of
nephews, and it was of course, quite possible that one or more of
them might be in military employ in Mesopotamia, though no one
could call to mind any particular nephew who could have been
suspected of being a Persian scholar.</p>
<p>The verses were attributed to one Ghurab, a hunter, or,
according to other accounts, warden of the royal fishponds, who
lived, in some unspecified century, in the neighbourhood of
Karmanshah. They breathed a spirit of comfortable,
even-tempered satire and philosophy, disclosing a mockery that
did not trouble to be bitter, a joy in life that was not
passionate to the verge of being troublesome.</p>
<blockquote><p>“A Mouse that prayed for Allah’s
aid<br />
 Blasphemed when no such aid befell:<br />
A Cat, who feasted on that mouse,<br />
 Thought Allah managed vastly well.</p>
<p>Pray not for aid to One who made<br />
 A set of never-changing Laws,<br />
But in your need remember well<br />
 He gave you speed, or guile—or claws.</p>
<p>Some laud a life of mild content:<br />
 Content may fall, as well as Pride.<br />
The Frog who hugged his lowly Ditch<br />
 Was much disgruntled when it dried.</p>
<p>‘You are not on the Road to Hell,’<br />
 You tell me with fanatic glee:<br />
Vain boaster, what shall that avail<br />
 If Hell is on the road to thee?</p>
<p>A Poet praised the Evening Star,<br />
 Another praised the Parrot’s hue:<br />
A Merchant praised his merchandise,<br />
 And he, at least, praised what he knew.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was this verse which gave the critics and commentators some
clue as to the probable date of the composition; the parrot, they
reminded the public, was in high vogue as a type of elegance in
the days of Hafiz of Shiraz; in the quatrains of Omar it makes no
appearance.</p>
<p>The next verse, it was pointed out, would apply to the
political conditions of the present day as strikingly as to the
region and era for which it was written—</p>
<blockquote><p>“A Sultan dreamed day-long of Peace,<br />
 The while his Rivals’ armies grew:<br />
They changed his Day-dreams into sleep<br />
 —The Peace, methinks, he never
knew.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Woman appeared little, and wine not at all in the verse of the
hunter-poet, but there was at least one contribution to the
love-philosophy of the East—</p>
<blockquote><p>“O Moon-faced Charmer, and
Star-drownèd Eyes,<br />
 And cheeks of soft delight, exhaling musk,<br />
They tell me that thy charm will fade; ah well,<br />
 The Rose itself grows hue-less in the
Dusk.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, there was a recognition of the Inevitable, a chill
breath blowing across the poet’s comfortable estimate of
life—</p>
<blockquote><p>“There is a sadness in each Dawn,<br />
 A sadness that you cannot rede:<br />
The joyous Day brings in its train<br />
 The Feast, the Loved One, and the Steed.</p>
<p>Ah, there shall come a Dawn at last<br />
 That brings no life-stir to your ken,<br />
A long, cold Dawn without a Day,<br />
 And ye shall rede its sadness then.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The verses of Ghurab came on the public at a moment when a
comfortable, slightly quizzical philosophy was certain to be
welcome, and their reception was enthusiastic. Elderly
colonels, who had outlived the love of truth, wrote to the papers
to say that they had been familiar with the works of Ghurab in
Afghanistan, and Aden, and other suitable localities a quarter of
a century ago. A Ghurab-of-Karmanshah Club sprang into
existence, the members of which alluded to each other as Brother
Ghurabians on the slightest provocation. And to the flood
of inquiries, criticisms, and requests for information, which
naturally poured in on the discoverer, or rather the discloser,
of this long-hidden poet, the Rev. Wilfrid made one effectual
reply: Military considerations forbade any disclosures which
might throw unnecessary light on his nephew’s
movements.</p>
<p>After the war the Rector’s position will be one of
unthinkable embarrassment, but for the moment, at any rate, he
has driven <i>The Forbidden Horsepond</i> out of the field.</p>
